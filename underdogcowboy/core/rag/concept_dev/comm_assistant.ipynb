    "## Project: Exporting and Enriching macOS Stickies Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal:\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to create a Python script that:\n",
    "1. Extracts notes from macOS Stickies.\n",
    "2. Enriches the notes with metadata using an LLM agent.\n",
    "3. Exports the enriched data to a JSON format suitable for indexing into a FAISS database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case:\n",
    "The enriched data will serve as a contextual layer for an LLM agent to provide communication advice. Specifically, the notes focus on follow-ups with individuals having different working styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow:\n",
    "1. **Extract Notes**: Read the Stickies database and retrieve the content of each note.\n",
    "2. **Generate Metadata**: Use an LLM agent to enrich the extracted content with metadata such as:\n",
    "   - Tags\n",
    "   - Priority\n",
    "   - Related People\n",
    "   - Communication Style\n",
    "   - Contextual Information\n",
    "3. **Export**: Save the enriched data to a structured JSON file for further use.\n",

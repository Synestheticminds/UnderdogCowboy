I\'ll analyze it based on the four key areas: Input, Output, Rules, and Constraints. I\'ll also provide feedback on strengths and areas for improvement.\n\n1. Input:\nStrength: The input is well-defined implicitly through examples and the system message. The agent expects users to provide Mermaid diagram code or descriptions of task chains.\nSuggestion: Consider explicitly stating the expected input formats (e.g., Mermaid code, natural language description of task chains) in the system message for clarity.\n\n2. Output:\nStrength: The expected output is clear - the agent should provide guidance, suggestions, and Mermaid code to help users create and refine their diagrams.\nSuggestion: You could enhance this by explicitly listing the types of outputs the agent should provide (e.g., Mermaid code snippets, explanations, Git commit reminders).\n\n3. Rules:\nStrength: The agent has clear guidelines for behavior, including focusing on Mermaid flowcharts, emphasizing input/output relationships, and encouraging Git commits.\nSuggestion: Consider organizing the rules into a numbered or bulleted list for easier reference. You could also add a rule about how to handle user questions that are outside the scope of Mermaid diagrams and Git commits.\n\n4. Constraints:\nStrength: The agent is constrained to focus on Mermaid diagrams, specifically flowcharts using "graph LR" syntax, and Git version control.\nSuggestion: You could be more explicit about what the agent should not do, such as not providing actual Git commands or not engaging in topics unrelated to diagram creation and version control.\n\nGeneral Feedback:\n1. The agent definition is comprehensive and provides a clear understanding of its purpose and capabilities.\n2. The examples provided are excellent and demonstrate the range of diagrams the agent should be able to assist with.\n3. The iterative nature of the process is well-emphasized throughout the definition.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Structure: Consider reorganizing the system message into clearly defined sections (e.g., "Purpose", "Key Responsibilities", "Knowledge Base", "Interaction Guidelines") for easier reference.\n\n2. Clarity on Git knowledge: Clarify the extent of Git knowledge the agent should have. While it\'s mentioned that the agent has "basic understanding", it\'s not clear if the agent should provide specific Git commands or just general reminders.\n\n3. Error handling: Add guidelines on how the agent should respond to incorrect Mermaid syntax or when users provide information that\'s not related to diagram creation.\n\n4. Personalization: Consider adding instructions for the agent to adapt its language and complexity based on the user\'s perceived expertise level.\n\n5. Consistency in examples: Ensure that all example diagrams use the "graph LR" syntax as mentioned in the system message.\n\nTo further refine this agent definition, consider the following questions:\n1. Should the agent provide specific Git commands, or only general reminders about committing changes?\n2. How should the agent handle requests for diagram types other than flowcharts?\n3. Is there a limit to the complexity of diagrams the agent should handle?\n4. Should the agent have any specific personality traits or communication style?\n\nOverall, this is a well-defined agent with a clear purpose and guidelines. With some minor refinements, it could become even more effective in assisting users with Mermaid diagrams and maintaining good version control practices.', 'last_feedback_output': 'Based on the provided system message and example Mermaid diagrams, I can offer the following feedback on how the agent understands the structure of the output it produces:\n\n1. Input:\nStrengths:\n- The agent clearly understands that it should expect users to provide descriptions of their task chains or current Mermaid code.\n- It\'s prepared to ask specific questions about subtasks and their relationships if the user\'s input is unclear.\n\nSuggestion for improvement:\n- The agent could benefit from a more structured approach to gathering initial input, perhaps by providing a template or a series of questions for users to fill out about their workflow.\n\n2. Output:\nStrengths:\n- The agent is well-prepared to produce Mermaid flowchart syntax, specifically using "graph LR" as the main concept.\n- It understands the importance of providing explanations along with code suggestions.\n- The example diagrams show a clear grasp of various output styles and complexities.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n- The agent could be more explicit about the different types of outputs it can provide (e.g., basic flowcharts, complex workflows with feedback loops, multi-agent systems).\n- It could benefit from a clearer understanding of when to use different Mermaid features like subgraphs or classDef, as these are present in the examples but not explicitly mentioned in the system message.\n\n3.

I\'ll analyze it based on the four key areas: Input, Output, Rules, and Constraints. I\'ll also provide feedback on strengths and areas for improvement.\n\n1. Input:\nStrength: The input is well-defined implicitly through examples and the system message. The agent expects users to provide Mermaid diagram code or descriptions of task chains.\nSuggestion: Consider explicitly stating the expected input formats (e.g., Mermaid code, natural language description of task chains) in the system message for clarity.\n\n2. Output:\nStrength: The expected output is clear - the agent should provide guidance, suggestions, and Mermaid code to help users create and refine their diagrams.\nSuggestion: You could enhance this by explicitly listing the types of outputs the agent should provide (e.g., Mermaid code snippets, explanations, Git commit reminders).\n\n3. Rules:\nStrength: The agent has clear guidelines for behavior, including focusing on Mermaid flowcharts, emphasizing input/output relationships, and encouraging Git commits.\nSuggestion: Consider organizing the rules into a numbered or bulleted list for easier reference. You could also add a rule about how to handle user questions that are outside the scope of Mermaid diagrams and Git commits.\n\n4. Constraints:\nStrength: The agent is constrained to focus on Mermaid diagrams, specifically flowcharts using "graph LR" syntax, and Git version control.\nSuggestion: You could be more explicit about what the agent should not do, such as not providing actual Git commands or not engaging in topics unrelated to diagram creation and version control.\n\nGeneral Feedback:\n1. The agent definition is comprehensive and provides a clear understanding of its purpose and capabilities.\n2. The examples provided are excellent and demonstrate the range of diagrams the agent should be able to assist with.\n3. The iterative nature of the process is well-emphasized throughout the definition.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Structure: Consider reorganizing the system message into clearly defined sections (e.g., "Purpose", "Key Responsibilities", "Knowledge Base", "Interaction Guidelines") for easier reference.\n\n2. Clarity on Git knowledge: Clarify the extent of Git knowledge the agent should have. While it\'s mentioned that the agent has "basic understanding", it\'s not clear if the agent should provide specific Git commands or just general reminders.\n\n3. Error handling: Add guidelines on how the agent should respond to incorrect Mermaid syntax or when users provide information that\'s not related to diagram creation.\n\n4. Personalization: Consider adding instructions for the agent to adapt its language and complexity based on the user\'s perceived expertise level.\n\n5. Consistency in examples: Ensure that all example diagrams use the "graph LR" syntax as mentioned in the system message.\n\nTo further refine this agent definition, consider the following questions:\n1. Should the agent provide specific Git commands, or only general reminders about committing changes?\n2. How should the agent handle requests for diagram types other than flowcharts?\n3. Is there a limit to the complexity of diagrams the agent should handle?\n4. Should the agent have any specific personality traits or communication style?\n\nOverall, this is a well-defined agent with a clear purpose and guidelines.

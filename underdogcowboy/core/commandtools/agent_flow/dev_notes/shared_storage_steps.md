### **Steps to Transition from the Current Solution to the Proposed Architecture**

| **Step** | **Description** | **Actions** |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **1**    | **Introduce Dataclasses** | - Define dataclasses for your data models (`SharedData`, `ScreenData`, `SessionData`).<br>- Update `SharedStorage` to use these dataclasses internally for data management. |
| **2**    | **Implement a Storage Interface** | - Create an abstract `StorageInterface` with methods for loading, saving, and listing sessions.<br>- Implement a `JSONStorageManager` that conforms to this interface, handling JSON file operations. |
| **3**    | **Refactor `StorageManager`** | - Modify `StorageManager` to use the `StorageInterface` instead of direct file operations.<br>- Ensure `StorageManager` focuses on session handling, not direct data manipulation.<br>- Move data manipulation methods into `SessionManager`. |
| **4**    | **Update `SessionManager`** | - Use the storage interface within `SessionManager` for all storage operations.<br>- Implement methods for accessing and updating shared and per-screen data.<br>- Utilize the dataclasses for data modeling within `SessionManager`. |
| **5**    | **Implement Namespacing for Per-Screen Data** | - Organize session data using namespaces (e.g., screen names) to separate per-screen data within `SessionData`.<br>- Update data access methods to handle namespaced data. |
| **6**    | **Update Screens to Use `SessionManager`** | - Modify screens to interact with `SessionManager` via a simplified interface.<br>- Remove direct dependencies on `StorageManager` or `SharedStorage` from screens.<br>- Ensure screens access data relevant to them using their namespace. |
| **7**    | **Implement Synchronization Logic** | - Define how session synchronization should behave across screens.<br>- Implement synchronization methods within `SessionManager` to handle shared data updates.<br>- Handle conflict resolution and data consistency during synchronization. |
| **8**    | **Test and Validate** | - Thoroughly test the application to ensure all functionalities work as expected.<br>- Validate data storage, retrieval, and session management.<br>- Test session synchronization across screens. |
| **9**    | **Document and Maintain** | - Update documentation to reflect the new architecture and data models.<br>- Document the interfaces and usage guidelines for `SessionManager` and storage components.<br>- Ensure code is well-commented and adheres to coding standards. |

**Additional Details for Each Step:**

#### **Step 1: Introduce Dataclasses**

- **Purpose**: To create structured and type-annotated data models that represent shared data, per-screen data, and session data.
- **Actions**:
  - Define `@dataclass` classes such as `SharedData`, `ScreenData`, and `SessionData`.
  - Refactor `SharedStorage` to use these dataclasses internally, replacing raw dictionaries and lists.

#### **Step 2: Implement a Storage Interface**

- **Purpose**: To abstract away the storage mechanism, allowing for flexibility in changing storage backends.
- **Actions**:
  - Define an abstract `StorageInterface` with methods like `load_session`, `create_session`, `save_session`, and `list_sessions`.
  - Implement `JSONStorageManager` that uses JSON files and conforms to `StorageInterface`.

#### **Step 3: Refactor `StorageManager`**

- **Purpose**: To decouple session handling from data manipulation and storage details.
- **Actions**:
  - Update `StorageManager` to interact with the storage interface rather than handling file operations directly.
  - Focus `StorageManager` on managing session lifecycle (e.g., creating, loading sessions).
  - Move data manipulation methods (e.g., `update_data`, `get_data`) into `SessionManager`.

#### **Step 4: Update `SessionManager`**

- **Purpose**: To centralize data management and provide a clean interface for screens to interact with session data.
- **Actions**:
  - Use the storage interface for all storage operations within `SessionManager`.
  - Implement methods to access and update shared data and per-screen data.
  - Utilize dataclasses (`SessionData`, `SharedData`, `ScreenData`) for data modeling.

#### **Step 5: Implement Namespacing for Per-Screen Data**

- **Purpose**: To prevent data collisions and clearly separate data belonging to different screens.
- **Actions**:
  - Organize session data using namespaces keyed by screen names within `SessionData`.
  - Update data access and update methods to include a `screen_name` parameter.
  - Ensure that each screen's data is stored and retrieved from its respective namespace.

#### **Step 6: Update Screens to Use `SessionManager`**

- **Purpose**: To decouple screens from storage details and provide a simplified interface for data interaction.
- **Actions**:
  - Modify screens to interact with `SessionManager` instead of `StorageManager` or `SharedStorage`.
  - Remove any direct file operations or storage logic from screen code.
  - Use methods like `get_screen_data` and `update_screen_data` for data access and updates.

#### **Step 7: Implement Synchronization Logic**

- **Purpose**: To allow sessions to be synchronized across screens when needed, aligning with your UX requirements.
- **Actions**:
  - Define how synchronization should work (e.g., which data is shared, how conflicts are resolved).
  - Implement synchronization methods within `SessionManager`, such as `synchronize_sessions`.
  - Ensure that synchronization updates shared data and notifies screens of changes if necessary.

#### **Step 8: Test and Validate**

- **Purpose**: To ensure that the new architecture functions correctly and meets all requirements.
- **Actions**:
  - Perform unit tests on individual components (e.g., `SessionManager`, storage implementations).
  - Conduct integration tests to verify that screens interact correctly with `SessionManager`.
  - Test session creation, loading, saving, data updates, and synchronization across screens.

#### **Step 9: Document and Maintain**

- **Purpose**: To facilitate future development and make onboarding easier for new developers.
- **Actions**:
  - Update or create documentation for the new architecture, including class diagrams and data flow diagrams.
  - Document the interfaces provided by `SessionManager` and storage components.
  - Ensure that code is well-commented, follows coding standards, and includes docstrings where appropriate.

By following these steps, you'll transition your application to a more robust, maintainable, and scalable architecture that aligns with best practices and supports your application's growth.
